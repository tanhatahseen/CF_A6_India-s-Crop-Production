# CF_A6_India-s-Crop-Production

The notebooks contain the Python scripts to wrangle, clean, manipulate, visualize data and applying machine learning algorithms. The cleaned dataset is also present in this folder.

This project is about analyzing India's annual crop production, and posing and answering some questions. Some machine learning techniques like Linear Regression, K-means Clustering, Time Series Analysis and Forecasting(SARIMAX, Prophet) are also applied.
